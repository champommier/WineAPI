/**
 * A function that filters bindings. It returns `true` to select a given
 * binding.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Originally, we allowed filters to be tied with a single value type.
 * This actually does not make much sense - the filter function is typically
 * invoked on all bindings to find those ones matching the given criteria.
 * Filters must be prepared to handle bindings of any value type. We learned
 * about this problem after enabling TypeScript's `strictFunctionTypes` check.
 * This aspect is resolved by typing the input argument as `Binding<unknown>`.
 *
 * Ideally, `BindingFilter` should be declared as a type guard as follows:
 * ```ts
 * export type BindingFilterGuard<ValueType = unknown> = (
 *   binding: Readonly<Binding<unknown>>,
 * ) => binding is Readonly<Binding<ValueType>>;
 * ```
 *
 * But TypeScript treats the following types as incompatible and does not accept
 * type 1 for type 2.
 *
 * 1. `(binding: Readonly<Binding<unknown>>) => boolean`
 * 2. `(binding: Readonly<Binding<unknown>>) => binding is Readonly<Binding<ValueType>>`
 *
 * If we described BindingFilter as a type-guard, then all filter implementations
 * would have to be explicitly typed as type-guards too, which would make it
 * tedious to write quick filter functions like `b => b.key.startsWith('services')`.
 *
 * To keep things simple and easy to use, we use `boolean` as the return type
 * of a binding filter function.
